Bad repositories will be excluded.
We've seen many repositories that encourage participants to make simple pull requests – to quickly gain a pull request towards winning. While these projects may be a valuable learning tool for new contributors, they often aren't valuable and high quality contributions to open source projects, and go against one of our core values for Hacktoberfest.

Some examples of projects that don’t follow the values of Hacktoberfest include:

Projects asking contributors to add their name or profile information to a list

Projects asking contributors to submit assorted data structures and algorithms (DSA)

Projects asking contributors to curate arbitrary lists of quotes, interview questions, etc.

The quality of pull requests is paramount; quantity comes second.

## How To Make Pull Request ? 

Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer.
Once a participant has submitted a pull request that is ready-to-review to a participating project, it must be approved by a maintainer of that project before it will count toward Hacktoberfest.

PRs can be accepted either by being merged, having an overall approving review, or having the ‘hacktoberfest-accepted’ label. *

After a PR is approved it enters a fourteen-day review window where our team can take action against any participants we believe to be contributing in bad faith, and maintainers can revoke their approval if they decide that a PR isn’t actually a legitimate contribution.

After the fourteen-day window has passed, the PR becomes eligible for Hacktoberfest and this cannot be reversed.
